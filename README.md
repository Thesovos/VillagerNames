## Introduction

A lighweight configurable plugin which gives all unnamed villagers a  chance of a randomized name. This plugin will name villagers when right-clicked by a player, emulating a typical RPG discovery effect. You can customize all of the villager names within the config file. The profession of the villager is also displayed in the nametag. 
By default villagers are given custom names on a 33.3% percent chance.  This can be changed within the plugin config file.
